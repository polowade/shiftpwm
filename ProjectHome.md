ShiftPWM is a library for Arduino to control many PWM outputs using shift registers (for example 74HC595). With this library you can control the brightness of many (RGB) LED's or the speed of many DC motors. Just 3 Arduino pins are used to create a lot more outputs.

If you have built something cool with ShiftPWM, let me now. I will add it to the online gallery.
